# Pivo

Pivo was designed to help you build _evolvable-by-design_ frontends.

:::tip

We define _evolvable-by-design_ as the ability of a UI to evolve along the four following properties of API evolution, at runtime, without changing their code.

- Additions and deletions to the parameters, URLs and fields of the operations and data structure in-use
- Modifications to the parameters, URLs, and fields of the operations and data structure in-use, that does not change their semantics
- Modification of control-flow and the pre-condition of the operations
- Movement of API elements.

:::

Concretely, Pivo replaces the HTTP client that you are used to use. In addition, you won't have to write service classes to call the API that you want to use. Pivo handle this for you.
